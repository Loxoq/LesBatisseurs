<h1>1) The project</h1>

The goal of this project was to code the board game "Les Batisseurs : Moyen-Ã‚ge" (published in 2014) in Java.
The program, in its basic version, must allow the user to play a game, by implementing its basic rules.
<br>This projet was divided in 3 main parts : the specifications writing (client's expectation, functionalities, tests planned...) ; the conception & analysis part (class diagrams construction,code's skeleton writing...) and the programming part (the productio of  the deliverable).

<h1>2) Diagrams</h1>

The different diagrams of this project has been done with Visual Paradigm.
<br>The **analysis class diagrams** are basics diagrams that only show the public class elements & the relationships between the different classes.
<br>The **conception class diagrams** are more detailed diagrams, that show the multiplicity between the different classes, and all the class' elements.
<br>The diagram showed in the synthesis document has been obtained by using the reverse code engineering tool from Visual Paradigm.

<h1>3) The code</h1>
The code's documentation can be found in the javaDoc folder.
<br>The code organization respect the MVC model, to make easier the programmation of the different interfaces.

<h1>4) To be implemented</h1>
There are a few functionalities that need to be implementend, if you follow what has been said in the specifications.
The biggest one is the implementation of a **functional** graphical interface. <br>The V1.0 of the project only provide menus panels, that are not linked to each other.
Some other functionalities :

+ Ingame music
+ Extension pack for the game (requires appropriate card scans)
+ Different IA levels
+ Ranking at the end of the game
+ Overview of the opponents' cards
